Part Overhaul Balance Integration
===

The Part Overhauls mod was published by Squad during the KSP 1.2 Pre-Release to showcase the new PartUpgrade feature and to preview the planned [Rocket Engine Overhaul](http://i.imgur.com/iINdJyL.jpg).

The visual overhaul has since been overtaken by and included in the [Restock project](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/182679-161-restock-revamping-ksps-art/). POBI aims to incorporate the PartUpgrade-based rebalance for 1.25m engines into the stock/Restock+ engines, thereby combining gameplay-optimized stats with the best available visuals.
